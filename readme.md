Developed the Pipeline (BT_CM.py) which serves as the "Scientific Expert" for the SatQuery Assistant. While the main UI handles the conversation, the engine performs the low-level signal processing and structural analysis required to provide "Evidence-Grounded" answers.

TOOLS:
Bi-Temporal Change: Implements a Siamese-style analysis pipeline. It uses sub-pixel image registration (ORB-features) and radiometric normalization (Histogram Matching) to align imagery from two different dates and extract a precise Change Evidence Mask.

Cross-Modal (SAR-Optical): A cloud-penetration logic module. It simulates RISAT-1A (Radar) backscatter signatures to detect water bodies and metallic structures (dams/ships), providing a "Structural Truth" layer that visual optical sensors miss.

Explainable AI (XAI) Dashboard: Generates Saliency Heatmaps (Grad-CAM style) to visualize the AI's neural attention. This proves the system is attending to actual geographic features, ensuring "Auditable Reasoning."

Core Signal Processing 
Lee-Filter Implementation: Applied adaptive noise reduction to handle speckle and sensor grain, significantly improving the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for detection.
SAR-Guided Synthesis: Developed a "Cloud-Free View" generator that uses SAR structural edges to "inpain" or reconstruct historical optical data behind monsoonal cloud cover.
Trust Metrics: Every analysis returns a Confidence Score based on the statistical reliability of the image alignment and signal variance.



FINAL INTEGRATED PIPELINE
A. Image Ingestion and Standardization
The system supports multi-format ingestion, specifically targeting GeoTIFF (Geospatial Metadata preserved) and standard raster formats (PNG/JPEG).
Radiometric Normalization: To account for varying solar angles and sensor illumination between different dates, the system performs Histogram Matching. This ensures that pixel-intensity shifts represent actual geographic changes rather than lighting artifacts.
Siamese Registration: For bi-temporal analysis, a sub-pixel alignment engine utilizes ORB Feature Descriptors and Affine Transformations to co-register image pairs. This minimizes "spatial jitter" and ensures that the bitemporal differencing is geometrically accurate.

B. Analytical Specialist Layer (Specialist Logic)
This layer acts as the scientific foundation, performing raw signal analysis before the AI interprets the data.
Bi-Temporal Change Pipeline: Implements a differencing engine that identifies structural variations between two dates. The engine utilizes morphological filtering and adaptive thresholding to isolate significant geographic shifts (e.g., urban sprawl, reservoir filling, deforestation).
Cross-Modal SAR Simulation: In accordance with the "All-Weather" requirement, the system simulates RISAT-1A SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) backscatter. By analyzing specular reflection (water detection) and structural corner reflectors (urban detection), it provides a "structural truth" layer that can validate findings through cloud cover.
Signal Processing & Noise Reduction: To ensure data integrity, the pipeline employs Adaptive Lee Filtering (specifically for SAR speckle) and Gaussian De-noising to improve the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the evidence masks.

C. Cognitive Reasoning Layer (Vision-Language Processing)
Once the signal data is processed, the system invokes a Large Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL) to interact with the user.
Grounded Prompting: Instead of a generic query, the system provides a "Knowledge-Rich Prompt" to the VLM. This prompt includes the math calculated by the Analytical Layer (e.g., "Intensity: 47%, SNR: 11dB"). This forces the AI to "reason" based on scientific facts rather than visual guessing.
Visual Question Answering (VQA): Provides descriptive, multi-sentence responses about the scene’s land cover, object count, and environmental status.
Text-Guided Visual Grounding: Integrates Grounding DINO logic to provide localized bounding boxes for user-specified targets (e.g., "Highlight all storage tanks"), satisfying the text-to-region grounding mandate.

3. Evidence Grounding & Auditable Metadata
A mandatory requirement of SIH PS-26167 is providing an "Evidence-Grounded Response." SatQuery AI satisfies this by generating an Auditable Execution Summary in JSON format for every analysis.
A. Scientific Trust Metrics
The system quantifies "Confidence" using three distinct mathematical indices:
Registration Confidence: Measures the geometric trust based on the density of feature inliers during image alignment.
Spatial Coherence: Evaluates if the detected change exists as a unified geographic block or random pixel noise.
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): Calculates the decibel (dB) strength of the geographic signal compared to the background grain of the sensor.
B. Explainable AI (XAI)
The system generates Visual Saliency Maps (Grad-CAM style) to provide transparency. These maps highlight the "Neural Attention" zones of the model, allowing operators to see exactly which pixels influenced the AI’s decision.
